        ##Girls Learning Code: Gamemaking with Scratch
        <br>

        #Using Scratch

        Scratch is a great tool for teaching coding concepts, and building fun and creative digital games. If you aren’t familiar with the program: great news! There are tons of free, online resources to get you started. Here are a few that we think are awesome:

        * Scratch <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#resources">Educator Resources</a> (especially the <a href="https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__0c1805349a6fe15c01c668d3f8acd971__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>)
        * Google CS First <a href="https://www.cs-first.com/training/introduction-computer-science-and-scratch">Training Materials</a>
        * Teachers Learning Code <a href="http://teacherslearningcode.com/assets/TLC-gettingstartedguide.pdf">Guide</a>
        * Scratch ED: Using the Scratch <a href="http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/scratch-teacher-accounts">Teacher Account</a>

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off

        See the kick-off <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ladieslearningcode.com/document/d/1OQVpGSjjv9l-Kg-9UaVieVGG1ssiVE6m9YrL4jANWpk/edit?usp=sharing">script</a>.

        #Code-Along

        Open up Scratch, go to “create” then click on “tips” in the top left toolbar. Choose a Code-Along activity from the Scratch Tips project list, under the “Step-by-Step” tab. Suggested activity: “Animate Your Name.” Go through the steps as learners follow along on their own screens. This is a chance for learners to become familiar with the tool, and begin exploring how the different blocks work.

        <br>
        #Work Session

        ##Ages 6-8 + parents

        Choose <strong>one</strong> activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13vVx3XwkvJuRs2ca2GVvLuixVlIkXkzbRYdzA14aOi8/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Maze Game. Show learners where to find the <strong>starter project</strong> in the class folder. Follow the <strong>solution sheet</strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right before the “Add-On” portion. Then, give time for learners to remix the project on their own. It might be helpful to brainstorm remix ideas for inspiration (refer to “Add-On” ideas). Leave time at the end for learners to test their games and share their projects with each other.

        In order to encourage learners and parents to work together as a cohesive team, it might be helpful to clarify roles during the activities. For example, after putting together a few lines of code, the parent can be the ‘tester’ and the learner the ‘de-bugger’: problem-solving to find solutions to any buggy code. Alternatively, the parent can verbalize each step of code while the learner searches for the relevant block. Ideally, the learner is in charge of navigating and completing tasks on the computer, while the parent supports them.

        ##Ages 9-12

        Choose <strong>two</strong> activities from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13vVx3XwkvJuRs2ca2GVvLuixVlIkXkzbRYdzA14aOi8/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. <strong>National Girls Learning Code Day activity: GLC Superhero Game</strong> <!--Suggested activities: Platform Game and Cave Surfer Game-->. Show learners where to find the <strong>starter project</strong> in the class folder. Follow the <strong>solution sheet</strong> as you lead the group in creating a working foundation, stopping right before the “Add-On” portion. Then, give time for learners to remix the project on their own. It might be helpful to brainstorm remix ideas for inspiration (refer to “Add-On” ideas). Leave time at the end for learners to test their games and share their projects with each other.

        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.
